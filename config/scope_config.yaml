    1. To further determine if the data in the paper is original spatial transcriptomic data generated by author and publicly accessible, you can follow these steps:
    - Check the **Methods** section for terms like "spatial transcriptomic", "spatial gene expression", "spatialtranscriptomics", or similar terms.
    - See if there's a **Data Availability** section listing GSE/GEO ID, Synapse ID (syn) or a direct download link.
    - **Include** the papers only if they clearly describe experimental generation and analysis of spatial transcriptomic data. **Exclude** studies that use only public data or do not perform new sequencing.
    - Review the **methods** section of each paper and select those that include spatial transcriptomic data from Spinocerebellar ataxia-related samples.
      Specifically, Include studies that perform spatial transcriptomic) using samples from either:
      * Spinocerebellar ataxia patient tissue, or
      * Spinocerebellar ataxia-simulated mouse models (e.g., 5xFAD, APP/PS1, or other transgenic models)
    - If there is no **Methods** section or **Data Availability** section, please carefully analyze full text and **Supplementary Materials** to determine if the data is original and publicly accessible.
    2. Moreover, the data related to the targeted disease: Spinocerebellar ataxia is the focus of the study, not just referenced in the introduction.

    1. Data related to the targeted disease: the paper should have a **primary focus** on **Spinocerebellar ataxia** — mere mention of the disease is **not sufficient** for relevance.
