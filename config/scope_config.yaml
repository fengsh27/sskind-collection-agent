    1. To further determine if the data in the paper is original scRNA-seq data generated by author and publicly accessible, you can follow these steps:
    - Check the **Methods** section for terms like "Single-Cell RNA sequencing", "scRNA-seq", "Single-nucleus RNA sequencing", "snRNA-seq", "Illumina", "Drop-seq", "Library" or specific platform (e.g., 10X Genomics).
    - See if there's a **Data Availability** section listing GSE/GEO ID, Synapse ID (syn) or a direct download link.
    - If there is no **Methods** section or **Data Availability** section, please carefully analyze full text and **Supplementary Materials** to determine if the data is original and publicly accessible.
    2. Moreover, the data related to the targeted disease: AD is the focus of the study, not just referenced in the introduction.
